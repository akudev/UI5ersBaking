# UI5ers Baking
After "[UI5ers Brewing](https://github.com/akudev/UI5ersBrewing)", this is the new *baking* branch of the UI5 family.

The one and only thing to get here right now is the UI5 logo Cookie Cutter 3D printing STL model and an example recipe for Butter Cookies ("Buttergebackenes").

## The UI5 Logo Cookie Cutter

Print with food-safe material! (PETG is a good start, but inform yourself about your concrete filament's ingredients. This is *your* sole responsibility.)

Clean well after use (or print anew to be on the safe side), the fine gaps in 3D-printed material can easily host parts of the dough and grow bacteria. Caution: PETG may be deformed in a dishwasher at standard temperature.

The STL files (alternatives, each file contains cutter and a stamp/plunger to push the dough out without ripping off the tips of the wings):
- [UI5-Cookie-Cutter_bigger-plunger.stl](resources/UI5-Cookie-Cutter_bigger-plunger.stl) - this one is recommended to be used by default.
- [UI5-Cookie-Cutter_smaller-plunger.stl](resources/UI5-Cookie-Cutter_smaller-plunger.stl) - has a smaller stamp, in case the above one fits the cutter too tightly. The cutter is the same.
- [UI5-Cookie-Cutter_extreme-deluxe-plunger.stl](resources/UI5-Cookie-Cutter_extreme-deluxe-plunger.stl) - comes with a stamp which also pushes out the dough outside the cutter. Doesn't look nice; if it was code, it would be a hack with `// FIXME` comment. The cutter of this one is modified to fit the stamp.

As the lower edge of the 3D-printed cutter is flat, press it with sufficient power to ensure the dough is fully cut.
